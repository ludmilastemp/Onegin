Admire it, as if he were trying.
All night, barely a foot away!
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
But, God, what tedium to sample
Falling ill like that, and dying;
It summons up respect, one can
Let us all follow his example!
My uncle, what a worthy man,
Of cosseting one who's half alive;
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
That sitting by the bed all day,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
"Why the devil can't you die?"
